            <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional attachment searches are fragmented, unverified, and vulnerable to scams.
                Students struggle to identify authentic opportunities, while companies lack a focused
                channel to reach serious candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Industrial Attachment Hub Center centralizes verified opportunities, eliminating guesswork
                and reducing exposure to fraudulent offers.
